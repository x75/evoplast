My branch of experimental work related to **evolution** and **plasticity**.

In Nature there is strong interaction between evolutionary and individual adaptation. In artificial evolution this interaction has only been given limited attention but offers huge potential. This project is a collection of my experiments in this direction.

Notable non-exhaustive foundations are
- Gregory Bateson: The Logical Categories of Learning and Communication, in Steps Toward an Ecology of Mind
- Kenneth Stanley & others: "A Hypercube-Based Encoding for Evolving Large-Scale Neural Networks". Artificial Life. 2009
- Paul Tonelli, Jean-Baptiste Mouret: On the Relationships between Generative Encodings, Regularity, and Learning Abilities when Evolving Plastic Artificial Neural Networks, PLOS ONE, November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79138
